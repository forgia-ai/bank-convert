# Mock Actions Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented mock actions throughout the application to enable full user flow testing without backend integration. All actions are functional and provide realistic user experiences.

## Mock Actions Implemented

### 1. Document Processing (`UserLimitsContext`)

**Function**: `processDocument(pageCount: number): Promise<boolean>`

**Behavior**:

- Simulates 2-second processing delay
- Checks user limits before processing
- Increments usage by specified page count
- Returns success/failure based on limits
- Logs processing to console

**Usage**: Called when users upload documents in viewer

### 2. Subscription Management (`UserLimitsContext`)

**Function**: `subscribeToPlan(plan: SubscriptionPlan): Promise<void>`

**Behavior**:

- Simulates 1-second API delay
- Updates user type and subscription plan
- Resets usage to 0 for fresh start
- Updates all limit calculations
- Logs subscription change to console

**Plans Available**:

- `free`: 50 pages total, $0
- `growth`: 500 pages/month, $8/month
- `premium`: Unlimited pages/month, $15/month

### 3. Usage Tracking (`UserLimitsContext`)

**Function**: `incrementUsage(pages: number): void`

**Behavior**:

- Immediately updates current usage
- Recalculates usage percentage
- Updates limit status flags (isAtLimit, isNearLimit, isCritical)
- Respects user's page limits

### 4. Rate Limiting (Anonymous Users)

**Implementation**: Built into `FileUploadModule` and context

**Behavior**:

- Tracks anonymous uploads via localStorage simulation
- Enforces 1 document per month per IP
- Shows rate limit modal when exceeded
- Redirects to signup when limit hit

## User Flow Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Anonymous User → Preview → Signup → Free Usage

1. **Homepage**: Upload document (works once per month)
2. **Preview Page**: See limited results (first 10 transactions)
3. **Signup**: Click CTA to create account
4. **Free Account**: Get 50 pages total
5. **Usage**: Process documents until limit reached
6. **Upgrade**: Subscribe to paid plan

### Scenario 2: Free User → Limit Reached → Upgrade

1. **Viewer**: Process documents (10 pages each)
2. **Usage Tracking**: See progress in navbar
3. **Limit Reached**: Modal appears at 50 pages
4. **Quick Upgrade**: Click "Upgrade to Growth" button
5. **Growth Plan**: Immediate access to 500 pages/month

### Scenario 3: Plan Management

1. **Pricing Page**: Click any plan button
2. **Instant Subscription**: No checkout process
3. **Redirect**: Automatic redirect to viewer
4. **Updated Limits**: New limits immediately active

## Mock Data Structure

### User Limits Data

```typescript
{
  userType: "anonymous" | "free" | "paid"
  subscriptionPlan: "free" | "growth" | "premium"
  currentUsage: number
  limit: number
  usagePercentage: number
  isAtLimit: boolean
  isNearLimit: boolean // 75%+
  isCritical: boolean // 90%+
  resetDate?: string // For paid users
  isMonthlyLimit: boolean
  planName: string
  planPrice: string
}
```

### Mock Transaction Data

- 10 realistic bank transactions
- Proper formatting (dates, amounts, descriptions)
- Mixed debit/credit transactions
- Used in both preview and viewer

## Component Integration

### Components with Mock Actions

1. **PricingCard**: Handles plan selection clicks
2. **UpgradePrompt**: Quick upgrade to Growth plan
3. **LimitReachedModal**: Upgrade buttons for different user types
4. **ConversionWorkflow**: Document processing with usage tracking
5. **FileUploadModule**: Anonymous rate limiting and preview generation
6. **UsageTracker**: Real-time usage display

### Context Integration

All components use `useUserLimits()` hook to:

- Access current user state
- Trigger mock actions
- Update UI based on limits
- Handle subscription changes

## Testing Instructions

### Test Anonymous Flow

1. Visit homepage in incognito mode
2. Upload a PDF file
3. View preview page with limited results
4. Try uploading again (should be rate limited)
5. Click signup CTA

### Test Free User Flow

1. Sign up for account
2. Upload documents in viewer
3. Watch usage tracker in navbar
4. Continue until 50 pages reached
5. See limit reached modal
6. Click "Upgrade to Growth"

### Test Subscription Changes

1. Go to pricing page
2. Click any plan button
3. Verify immediate subscription change
4. Check updated limits in viewer
5. Test document processing with new limits

## Console Logging

All mock actions log to console for debugging:

- `Mock: Processed document with X pages`
- `Mock: Subscribed to X plan`
- Rate limiting events
- Usage updates

## Ready for Backend Integration

All mock functions are clearly marked with TODO comments and can be easily replaced with real API calls:

```typescript
// TODO: Replace with actual API call
const success = await processDocument(pageCount)

// TODO: Integrate with Stripe and backend
await subscribeToPlan(plan)
```

The mock implementation provides a complete, functional user experience that demonstrates all planned features and conversion flows.
